# Emotion Detection Using CNN and OpenCV

- Introduction

This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks. This Model is trained on the face recognition dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset). It contains over 35000 images of diffrent emotions.

- Dependencies

requirements.txt file contains all the necessary dependencies for the project.
To install the required packages, run pip install -r requirements.txt.

- Working

You will need to download the haarcascades file for facial recognition.
Visit the OpenCV GitHub repository and download the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file. (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)

Load the json and model(.h5) file.
